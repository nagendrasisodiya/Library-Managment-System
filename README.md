# Library-Managment-System
📚 Library Management System
Hey there! 👋 This is my take on a library management system - a REST API built with Spring Boot that helps keep track of books, users, and all that good stuff.
What's This All About?
I built this to make running a library easier - you know, keeping track of who's borrowed what, when books are due back, and making sure only the right people can access certain features. It's like having a super organized librarian, but in code form!
Cool Things It Can Do

Keep track of all your books 📖
Handle user accounts securely 🔐
Let admins manage everything easily
Keep the books organized and tracked
Make sure users can only see what they're supposed to see

Tech Stuff I Used
Built this with Spring Boot because, well, it's awesome! Also threw in:
Spring Security for keeping things safe
JWT tokens for logging in (fancy, right?)
Some database magic with JPA/Hibernate
CORS setup ready to play nice with your frontend
